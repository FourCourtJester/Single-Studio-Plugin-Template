# single-studio-plugin-example

A plugin for [Single Studio](https://fourcourtjester.github.io/Single-Studio/): it
reads something from the outside world and emits events a studio can build graphics
on.

Replace this paragraph with what yours reads, and the name everywhere with yours.

## Using it, from a studio

```bash
npm i single-studio-plugin-example
```

```js
// src/studio/velcro.worker.js
import { createVelcroHost } from '@single-studio/core/worker'
import { example, ExampleHandler } from 'single-studio-plugin-example'

class MyShow extends ExampleHandler {
  onScore({ home, away }) {
    this.mutate('set', {
      'variables.home.score': home.score,
      'variables.away.score': away.score,
    })
  }
}

createVelcroHost({ name: STUDIO_ID, mutations, plugins: [example(MyShow)] })
```

The operator sets the address and any credential on their own board, under
**Plugins** — those belong to the machine, not to the build.

### What it emits

| Event      | Method       | Payload                                            |
| ---------- | ------------ | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `score`    | `onScore`    | `{ home: { name, score }, away: { name, score } }` |
| `period`   | `onPeriod`   | `{ period, clock }`                                |
| `finished` | `onFinished` | `{ winner }`                                       |

Every payload also carries `raw`, which is the frame exactly as it arrived.

## Building your own from this

```bash
npm install
npm test
```

Then read [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) — it covers which of the two shapes to keep, what
belongs on the operator's panel, and the two things that bite at publish time.

The short version:

1. Pick `ExampleSocket` or `ExamplePoller` in `src/index.js` and delete the other.
2. Rewrite `src/events.js` to match what your far end actually sends.
3. Rename the package, and the `name` inside `definePlugin`.

## Licence

**This template is public domain — the [Unlicense](LICENSE).** Take it, change it,
publish what you make, charge for it. No permission needed, no attribution required,
nothing owed, and no copyright of anyone else's ends up in your repository.

It was written for [Single Studio](https://github.com/FourCourtJester/Single-Studio)
by Shaun "FourCourtJester" Delaney, which is the courtesy version of that sentence
rather than a condition of it.

**Then pick your own licence.** Once the starter code is your plugin, `LICENSE` is
dedicating *your* work to the public domain, which is a real choice but should be a
deliberate one. Replace the file with whatever you want — MIT is the usual answer —
and set `license` in `package.json` to match it.

The framework itself is a different question: `@single-studio/core` is MIT and stays
that way, with its own licence inside `node_modules`. Nothing here changes that, and
depending on it asks nothing of you.
