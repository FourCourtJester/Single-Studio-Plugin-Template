# Working on this plugin

For anyone — person or agent — building a Single Studio plugin from this template.

## What a plugin is, and what it deliberately is not

A plugin brings the outside world in — a game, a spreadsheet, a scoring service — and
**emits events**. It does not write to anybody's show.

That single rule decides three things at once. A plugin installed from npm has no
authority over a broadcast, so nobody has to audit a dependency for it. It imposes no
vocabulary, so a studio that already calls things `home.score` keeps calling them
that. And it is testable with no store at all: feed the parser a frame, assert on the
event.

The studio author writes what a goal _means_ to their graphics. You write what
arrived.

## First job: pick a shape and delete the other

`src/index.js` ships two classes. Keep one.

|                     |                                                                  |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **`ExampleSocket`** | for something that **tells** you — a game, OBS, a chat service   |
| **`ExamplePoller`** | for something that must be **asked** — a spreadsheet, a REST API |

If the far end offers both, take the socket: a poll that finds nothing still costs a
request, and a socket that says nothing costs nothing.

Then delete the other class, its tests in `test/plugin.test.js`, and whichever of
`SocketService`/`PollingService` is now unused from the import.

Both shapes emit the same events from the same table. That is worth noticing before
you delete one: the shape is an implementation detail, and `src/events.js` is the
contract a studio writes against.

## The order to build it in

1. **`src/events.js` first**, before anything connects. This is where a plugin's bugs
   actually live — a wrong field name is a graphic reading `undefined` for a whole
   broadcast, with nothing to see and nothing to log. It needs no network and no
   fake, so it is the cheapest useful thing you can write.
2. **The service.** `url` and `receive` for a socket; `read` and `fatal` for a poller.
3. **`handles` and the no-op methods**, one per event.
4. **`config` and `help`**, which is what an operator actually sees.

## What belongs on the operator's panel

The test is: **is it a fact about this computer, or about this show?**

A port number chosen by whoever runs the game is theirs — panel. A spreadsheet range
that your graphics expect columns in is the studio's; putting it on the panel invites
somebody to change it mid-show and see the wrong column with no error anywhere. Take
those as arguments to the factory instead.

`type: 'secret'` masks a field. It does **not** hide it at runtime — the request is
made from a browser, so the value is in the network tab of the machine running the
board. It is restriction, not concealment. Say so in the `help`, and lead with how to
restrict the credential rather than mentioning it in passing.

## Testing

```bash
npm install
npm test
```

`@single-studio/core/testing` gives you `FakeSocket` and `fakeSockets()`. Subclass the
fake to add your protocol's own shorthand — see `ExampleFeed` in the tests.

**Make the fake exactly as awkward as the wire.** The most expensive bug this
framework has had was a fake that was tidier than the game: Rocket League nests a JSON
_string_ inside its frame, the fake passed an object, and every field read `undefined`
while the suite stayed green for weeks. Making the fake faithful turned seven passing
tests red at once. A fake that is easier to write than the protocol is a fake that is
lying to you.

**Negative-test every check you add.** Break the code it is meant to catch, watch it
go red, put the code back. A check that cannot fail reads exactly like coverage and
is worse than nothing.

## Publishing

This ships **source**, not a build — a studio's bundler compiles it, so there is no
build step, no `dist`, and no bundler config to keep working.

Three things that will bite:

- **`@single-studio/core` must stay a `peerDependency`.** If it is a normal
  dependency, npm is free to install a second copy — and two copies of the framework
  in one worker means two document registries. The plugin connects, emits, and
  nothing reaches the show. It fails silently, which is the worst way for it to fail.
- **Relative imports need their `.js`.** Your source is resolved by Node, not by a
  bundler, so `from './events'` throws on install where `from './events.js'` works.
  The example files are correct; copy their style.
- **`repository` must name your repository if you publish with `--provenance`.**
  npm compares it against the repository that built the tarball and refuses the
  publish outright — `422 ... "repository.url" is "", expected to match ...` — rather
  than quietly publishing unsigned. `package.json` here says `YOUR-NAME/YOUR-REPO`;
  change it. Nothing local catches this: `npm pack` builds the tarball happily and
  the refusal only comes back from npm's servers.

Before publishing: `npm test`, then `npm pack` and look inside the tarball. npm
refuses to unpublish after 72 hours.

## Naming

The npm package name is yours — `single-studio-plugin-<thing>`, or your own scope.
`@single-studio/` is not available to you and nothing requires it.

The `name` inside `definePlugin` is different and unrelated: it is what a studio
addresses the plugin by (`ctx.ask('example', …)`) and the key its settings are stored
under. Keep it short, lowercase, and no scope.
